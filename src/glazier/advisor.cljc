(ns glazier.advisor
  "Glazier Advisor — proposing a job-site scheduling/logistics
  coordination operation (log a work record, schedule a crew
  operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a glazing-materials
  supply order) from a crew roster, job-site registration and
  safety-reporting policy. Swappable mock/llm; the advisor ONLY
  proposes — `glazier.governor` independently gates every proposal
  and always escalates safety concerns and above-threshold supply
  orders. The advisor never proposes to directly finalize a
  glazing-installation-execution decision (e.g. deciding to proceed
  with a specific glass-panel installation) or to override a site
  safety officer's judgment — those stay permanently out of this
  actor's scope. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7111's
  housebuilder.advisor for the physical-safety-domain shape.
